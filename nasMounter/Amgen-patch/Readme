1. On the source system, make a directory to download the SIOS scripts and tar file
node1 # mkdir -p /tmp/sios-conv
2. cd /tmp/sios-conv
3. Download the script nasMounterAmgenConversion.pl and SIOS_enhancedMounter_gen_app-<version>.tgz.  Do not extract .tgz
4. chmod a+x nasMounterAmgenConversion.pl
5. execute the nasMounterAmgenConversion.pl
        Usage:
        full_path_to_tarfile - full path to the SIOS_enhancedNasMounter
        tag - resource tag
        mntPoint - the nas mount point
        nfsServerIP - the IP of the nfs server
        nfsExport - the actual NFS share being exported by the nfs server
        mntOptions - mount options for the nas mount point (mntPoint)
    Example: /tmp/sios-conv/nasMounterAmgenConversion.pl /tmp/sios-conv/SIOS_enhancedNasMounter_gen_app-05.00.21.tgz nasSQA /sapmnt/SQA 172.17.2.13 /export/sapmnt/SQA rw-sync-soft-bg-intr-timeo=30-retrans=2
